# Fetch Users API (Mini Project)

This is my mini project where I learned how to fetch data from an API using JavaScript.  
I used the **JSONPlaceholder Users API** (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) to get sample user data and display it on a webpage.

## What I Learned
- How to use the **fetch()** function in JavaScript
- How to work with **JSON data**
- How to display data dynamically on a webpage



## How to Run
1. Open the project folder.
2. Run the `index.html` file in any browser.
3. It will show a list of users with their details.



## Tech Stack
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript (Fetch API)


## Purpose
This is a simple practice project to improve my JavaScript skills and understand how API calls work.
